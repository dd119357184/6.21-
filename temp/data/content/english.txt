China will also be contributing technical expertise and equipment in the future

It was found out that the drugs have been delivered to the Philippines and the Chinese officials immediately informed their Philippine counterparts, alerting them about the drug shipment
With regard to the May 25 bust of a drug trafficking ring and seizure of 604 kilograms of crystal meth, according to the meeting, the Chinese Customs officials discovered the attempt to smuggle the illegal drugs into the Philippines
Philippine law enforcers seized the drugs around midnight and it took less than four hours for the cross-border operation to be implemented
The two sides refuted distorted reports recently published by certain media, stressing that the fake news were neither in the interests of bilateral anti-drug cooperation, nor in the interests of the two peoples
According to the meeting, real-time intelligence sharing, coordination, drug rehabilitation are just some of the practices that both countries are looking at in their anti-drug cooperation
The Chinese officials were from China's National Narcotics Control Commission and Ministry of Public Security while Philippine officials were from Philippines' Dangerous Drugs Board and Bureau of Customs
The Chinese side reiterated that like the current Philippine government, the Chinese government maintains "zero tolerance" policy on illicit drugs, calling on the two sides to further enhance and strengthen collaborative efforts to bust drug smugglers
Noting that the anti-drug cooperation between China and the Philippines has gone through a long history and achieved fruitful results, the two sides said the current cooperation has entered an increasingly good period
[Photo/Agencies]MANILA - China and the Philippines have fully affirmed the positive results achieved so far in their anti-drug cooperation, vowing to further strengthen their cooperation in this regard in the future
The comments and pledge came as officials from the two countries met here recently on the sidelines of the 11th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Transnational Crimes
The Chinese and Pakistani air forces have cooperated in planning and implementing strategies, as well as learning operational concepts and tactics from each other through sitting in the same fighter during the ongoing joint drills named "Shaheen VI" from Sept 7 to 27

Letting them work here can make better use of their contribution, and also working in a country can give the foreigners more opportunities to develop a more profound understanding of the country
In the urban area of Hefei, there is a hill called Dashu Hill
I think China should attract even more foreigners, because from my own experience, having a look at the real China, not just the view from overseas, makes a big difference
"China is developing very fast and will play more important roles in the world
The two countries must promote cooperation in many areas, but how can cooperation go well if our next generation doesn't understand Chinese?" Cho asked
"In the past 21 years, I have witnessed great development achievements in China, and I believe the five years to come after the pending 19th CPC National Congress will bring the country a more prosperous future
Also, Xi has been very good at choosing the right people to work with him
I was one of the torchbearers for the Beijing Olympic Games torch relay in Hefei in 2008
Impressed by how the history teacher had influenced her son, Cho has encouraged Chinese students to go to South Korea
Travelers had to change flights in Shanghai or Nanjing, Jiangsu province
The university was the first in the province to have such a course
She also serves as an economic counselor for the Hefei Economic and Technological Development Area, where Hefei University is based, and the Hefei High-Tech Industry Development Zone
"My husband and I came to China - to Hefei - to fulfill my elder son's dream
How to make the other countries believe a rapidly developing China is not a threat is really a tough issue
Within a year, she moved to the city with her husband, Park Nam-gyu, and her sons
I hope it can play a more important role in world peace in the future
"In the early years, transportation between Hefei and South Korea was not convenient
In 2002, she became the first person from her country to receive China's Friendship Award, the highest honor given to foreigners by the central government
"He wanted to go to the inland provinces, and he had some knowledge of Anhui, so he chose Hefei as his destination," Cho said
Half a year later, Park returned to Hefei University and has been there ever since
Some of the South Korean companies based in the two zones, the largest in the province, were attracted through Cho's efforts
In the runup to the meeting, China Daily asked a prominent South Korean teacher to talk about her experiences in promoting educational improvements, business cooperation and people-to-people understanding in her native country and her adopted home
And she was the first South Korean citizen to gain permanent residency in China in 2006
The boy - a great fan of Chinese history who was able to give the names of more than 900 figures in the Chinese classic Romance of Three Kingdoms - was inspired and wanted very much to follow the suggestion
President Xi puts a lot of emphasis on environmental protection
What's the most memorable experience you've had in China, or related to China? Unforgettable experiences in China are many
It also extends to boosting Sino-South Korean economic ties and helping the province's poverty-stricken areas
Cho's reputation is not limited to education, however
When we were living in a community about 10 kilometers away, we could seldom see the hill from the window
What's the biggest challenge China faces, and how do you think the country should go about overcoming it? The biggest challenge could come from the changes
The improvement of the people's confidence itself is one of the biggest achievements
In 2010, she was listed as one of the most influential women of the century in Hefei
Editor's Note: The Communist Party of China will hold its 19th National Congress on Oct 18
More policies should also be made to attract more foreign talent to work in China
It was unforgettable because my family watched the relay in South Korea in 1988 but didn't get the chance to participate
"Now I often accompany Hefei officials to South Korea for business recruitment and students for educational exchanges," Cho said
"Nowadays, flights connecting Hefei with Incheon in South Korea are available five days a week, and the situation is improving
Dozens of universities are located here, including the University of Science and Technology of China, one of the country's best," she said
Before they became major officials, dozens of years should have passed and they should have collected enough experience to tackle seemingly tough problems
In 1998, when she was back in her hometown, Cho delivered a three-hour speech to 82 heads of primary schools, trying to persuade them to offer Chinese courses
A teacher of Korean at Hefei University in Anhui province, Cho has helped to boost the two countries' ties in multiple aspects - not just in education
The couple found employment quickly at Hefei University and began teaching Korean the next year
cn &#160;Cho Sung-hye talks with her students at Hefei University in Anhui province
The latest example was a 2016 donation of 20,000 yuan ($3,000) to four high school graduates in Hefei's Feidong county who had been enrolled at universities but were about to give up for lack of money
What is your impression of President Xi Jinping? I think he is a determined man
After finishing middle school and high school studies in the city, Cho's elder son was admitted to Peking University for undergraduate studies, and then returned to Hefei later for his MBA at the University of Science and Technology of China
She has played a prominent role in education, business development and friendship
After about a year in Hefei, Park took a job in the United States and tried to persuade Cho to give up Hefei
What three words would you use to describe China today? Revitalizing, changing, confident
In 2000, with Cho's help, the Banyang Elementary School - in which she had studied - began teaching Chinese
"I told him that we had just started here and we should at least spend five years in the city before judging whether we should move to another place," Cho said
"There were even South Korean businessmen who intended to invest in Hefei but decided to invest in Shanghai and Nanjing instead, as they found the two cities to be more developed," she added
China is a big country, so officials have to collaborate with each other well
I don't believe the Western countries' political practices could work in China, though many of them are considered successful by the Westerners themselves
First, China is playing an increasingly important role in the world, so some neighboring countries, and especially some developed Western countries may regard China as a challenger to the power they have maintained for many years
She has helped more than 3,000 students from Anhui to study in her country, and more than 1,000 were given job opportunities there
One of the results is that the Chinese people are more confident than ever about their country's development
It's hard to make long-term predictions, but I hope China can keep its own development pace and have its own development patterns
I believe that in the coming five years, the gap between coastal and inland regions will be narrowed
Opening up to the world has brought dramatic changes to the coastal regions, which have been more developed that the inland areas
Cho's brothers and sisters also brought their children to Hefei
The younger one attended Anhui University of Chinese Medicine and earned bachelor's and master's degrees there
"When the eldest of my two sons was in the third year of middle school, his history teacher, who had some experience in China, suggested the students go to live there and have a close look at the old country," Cho said
Before coming to China as an adult, she worked at Soon Chun Hyang University as a teacher
"On the visit to Hefei, I found it was not very developed but thought it would have great potential
To better promote the educational exchanges, Cho and her husband founded the Handa Cultural Exchange Co in Hefei in 2006, with Cho as president
She herself knew little of the province or its capital at that time, so she decided to have a look before taking her family there
"In the five years since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, China has invested more than ever before in poverty relief, and President Xi Jinping has vowed to eliminate poverty by 2020," Cho noted
She is now helping the development area build a China-South Korea Industry Park, and she has already brought in three South Korean companies to invest in the city's high-tech zone
Officials should all start from basic positions and get promotions gradually
He has been trying his best to achieve what he has vowed to do
I became the first South Korean person to receive the Chinese Central Government's Friendship Award in 2002 and the first from my country to get permanent residency in China in 2006
We didn't expect that we would come to love the country as much as we do," said Cho, who speaks fluent Mandarin
Some of China's practices are also worth learning, such as how it trains its officials
" What do you feel has been China's biggest achievement over the past five years? What's the most notable change you've observed? China has achieved much in many aspects over the last five years
Over the last 21 years, South Korean teacher Cho Sung-hye has contributed much to the friendship between the people of her country and China
A remarkable South Korean teacher took up residence in Hefei, Anhui province, at the urging of her young son and never looked back
"Nowadays all the primary schools in my country have made Chinese-language courses available to students," said Cho, who was believed by some local media to have given the strongest push to the achievement
It was the first primary school in the country to do so
"At the peak, I had 21 relatives living here, and there are still 12 of them now," Cho said
For the last five years, the air has been clearing up
What do you think China will be like in five years' time? How do you view China's longer-term future? Chinese people's incomes have increased significantly in recent years and they will become richer in the next five years
" Cho and her husband have also donated hundreds of thousands of yuan to help prevent the children of poverty-stricken rural families in Anhui from dropping out of school
Cho said the number of the poverty-stricken students is declining, and they can now get more financial support from the government, rather than relying on occasional social donations
Do you believe that some of China's experiences or practices could be used to solve pressing global problems? If so, what are they? China has a very mature and comprehensive system to foster leadership
What are your expectations for the upcoming 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China? What are the key issues you care about most? I think China loves peace more than some of the developed countries
In recent years, I have received numerous awards from the Chinese government
And she has brought even more students from South Korea to China
By comparing these figures, Pew seems to suggest that China and the US are engaging in a popularity contest in the Philippines
Meanwhile, two-thirds say having a strong economic relationship with China is more important for ties between the two nations, while only 28 percent say being tough with China on territorial disputes is more vital
Fully 86 percent have a favorable view of Duterte himself; 78 percent support his handling of the illegal-drugs issue; and 62 percent say that the Philippines government is making progress in its anti-drug campaign
That was certainly not the policy under Obama when he launched the US pivot-to-Asia policy, trying to gang up US allies on China
And on global economic status, about half of Filipinos (49 percent) say that the US is still the leading economic power, but that is down from 66 percent who said so in 2015
But Filipinos also share positive views of China and its leader, President Xi Jinping
Since becoming Philippines president in June 2016, Rodrigo Duterte has refused to be used by the US to advance its strategy
However, the Pew survey finds that Duterte and his policies are widely popular at home despite concerns expressed by some governments, in particular the US, over Duterte's clashes with drug cartels and alleged human rights violations
In 2014, the Philippines was still led by Aquino III
This represents a dramatic shift since that question was last asked in 2015
It clearly suggests that one's gain is another's loss
The Philippines under Duterte has tried to develop an independent foreign policy rather than being a US puppet most of the time
The US government, lawmakers and pundits have generally expressed negative views of Duterte since he took office last June
And overall, the perception gap between the US and China in the Philippines is narrowing
According to the survey, 78 percent in the Philippines have a positive view of the US as of this spring, down from 92 percent who expressed positive sentiments in 2015
But the Philippines, and indeed all the countries in the region, should be encouraged to have good relations with both China and the US, a real win-win situation for not just the three countries involved, but for the region and the world
At the same time, 78 percent believe the current economic situation is good, and 57 percent are satisfied with the direction of the country, a 21 percentage-point increase from 2014, the last time this question was asked in the Philippines
Some even believe that he would not able to serve the full six-year term
A zero-sum mentality about China-US relations is reflected not only in the thinking of some US politicians, but also in a new survey conducted by the Pew Research Center
The report finds that people in the Philippines still like the US and have confidence in its leader, President Donald Trump
The survey released on Sept 21 bore a title saying people in the Philippines still favor the United States over China, but that the gap is narrowing
A quarter now name China as the world's leading economy, up from 14 percent the last time the Philippines was surveyed
Such an independent policy is dealing a heavy blow to those who still view the relationship between the three countries as zero-sum
And despite the Philippines being the most pro-Trump nation in Pew's spring 37-country survey, confidence in Trump now is lower than it was in then-President Barack Obama in 2015
The US was believed to be fully behind the scenes when the Philippines, under President Benigno Aquino III, filed the arbitration suit in 2013 against China in a tribunal in The Hague, a case in which China had refused to participate
His tough rhetoric on the US and softened rhetoric on China, especially compared with his predecessor Aquino III, has worried many in the US
The Obama administration had done everything it could to internationalize the South China Sea issue and had used the Philippines, a US ally, to advance the American strategy
The negotiations may take days or weeks before a deal is struck between the future governing partners
Winston Peters, the party chief of the New Zealand First Party, however, refused to say which party he would side with
AUCKLAND - New Zealand's parliamentary elections on Saturday yield no clear winner as tally ended in the wee hours of Sunday, leaving the third largest party with 7
The New Zealand First Party has garnered nine seats, making it the indispensable coalition partner for both the National Party and the Labor Party to form the government
The ruling National Party has secured 46 percent of the party votes, which transfer to 58 seats in the 120 member Congress in an Mixed-Member Proportional voting system, with the opposition Labor Party lagging behind at 35
8 percent votes or seven seats in the congress would just make enough seats to form a government if they can successfully get the New Zealand First Party on board
According to the Ministry of Education of the Inner Mongolia, the exhibition attracted 39 universities from 16 countries, including Mongolia, Russia, the United States, Britain and South Korea
It showcased the achievements of Chinese and foreign universities in education exchange, personnel training, and scientific research cooperation
Teachers and students of Inner Mongolia Normal University gave performances at the event, including Tai Chi, flute playing, and Mongolian songs and dances, which have won generous applause
The China-Mongolia Education and Technology Exhibition was held in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia autonomous region on Sept 26, when nine cooperation agreements were signed by eighteen Chinese and foreign universities
The pandas were born at the Ya'an Bifengxia base, part of the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan
Caitao and Huchun will live in a 4,800-square-meter panda park at Taman Safari Indonesia for 10 years
The two seven-year-old pandas will be flown from Chengdu to Jakarta by Indonesian state airline Garuda Indonesia at 4:10 am Thursday

Yingluck denied all the charges when giving her closing oral statement on Aug 1, arguing she was not responsible for the day-to-day running of the scheme and insisted she was a victim of political persecution
In the scheme, Yingluck's government paid Thai rice farmers inflated prices for their crops, driving up global rice prices
File photo shows ousted former Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra arrives at the criminal court in Bangkok, Thailand, Sept 29, 2015
[Photo/Agencies]BANGKOK - Thailand's Supreme Court on Wednesday found former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra guilty of malfeasance in a loss-ridden rice subsidy program and sentenced her in absentia to five years in jail
Yingluck did not show up at the court and has so far not made any public comment on the verdict
In an announcement released by the court, it read that even though the unmilled rice program was an act according to government policy that the cabinet had stated to the National Assembly, if the implementation of such policy was not in accordance with law, such acts could be inspected by the judicial process
Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said on Tuesday that he knows where the ousted former prime minister is but will not disclose her whereabouts until the verdict is delivered
After a trial running over two years, the Supreme Court's Criminal Division for Holders of Political Positions began reading the verdict at 11 am local time and continued for nearly four hours
The subsidy scheme did not work, costing the country 8 billion US dollars and leaving it with vast stockpiles of rice
It was reported that she had fled to Dubai where her brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, lives in self-imposed exile avoiding a 2008 sentence for corruption
Her lawyer said she was ill with an ear problem and could not appear in court
The verdict was supposed to be read on Aug 25, but Yingluck, the country's first woman prime minister, failed to show up
The court then issued an arrest warrant on her and postponed the verdict
Yingluck could be sentenced to as much as 10 years in prison if found guilty of negligence over a costly rice subsidy scheme that helped to bring her to power in an election in 2011
"The ginger output of the base can reach nearly 100,000 kg, whose production value is one million yuan ($150,716) as long as appropriate technologies and management skills are used," said Wang
He studied at China Three Gorges University and has lived in China for 11 years, during which he fell in love with Lyu Xueqin, a woman from Enshi, Hubei province, who became his wife later
Kottuvala Abdul Mateed from India helps his Chinese father-in-law to expand their ginger business abroad
cn]A 31-year-old Indian in Central China's Hubei province cultivates ginger with his Chinese father-in-law at their home village and exports it to countries in Asia, North America and Latin America, Chutian Metropolis Daily reported
The family's business also received local government's support, which arranged experts from universities to provide guidance and helped them construct a cellar, which is capable of storing 150,000 kg of ginger
The couple established a company in South China's Guangdong province to export various agriculture products, including ginger, to countries, such as India, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and United States, through Dubai port
The man, originally from New Delhi, gave himself a Chinese name called Wang Wei, same as one of the most famous poets in Tang Dynasty (618-907)
The seeds grew up successfully and they decided to set up a ginger cultivation base spread over 2
Last year, Wang together with his father-in-law, Lyu Weiping, brought ginger seeds and cultivation technology to their home village in Hubei after inspecting them in East China's Shandong province
The two sides will exchange views on bilateral ties, US President Donald Trump's visit to China this year, and major international and regional issues, Lu said

The training course on the Chinese lion dance is part of the 2017 China Africa Cultures in Focus, an activity held by the Bureau for External Cultural Relations of Chinese Ministry of Culture to strengthen the cultural communication between China and African countries
They kept practicing from morning until night, trying to master the basic skills of lion dance, routines and instrumental music within a short period
The cultural center of the Jinpu New Area has undertaken the course for three consecutive years since 2015
The cultural center of the Jinpu New Area also arranged some courses for them to know about other traditional Chinese culture such as Chinese calligraphy, seal cutting, folk dance, paper-cutting, and pottery
During the 35-day training course, they learned from Li Mingxu, the fifth generation successor of the Jinzhou Lion Dance, a provincial intangible cultural heritage that has been passed from generation to generation for more than a century
Ten students from Nigeria and Zambia learned how to perform Chinese lion dance at the Jinpu New Area in Dalian, Northeast China's Liaoning province
What has it to do with dissolving the lower house now?" said Seiji Maehara, leader of the largest opposition Democratic Party
TOKYO - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced at a press conference on Monday that he will dissolve the House of Representatives when it convenes Thursday to pave way for a general election next month
The prime minister cited the need to seek a fresh mandate to overcome "a national crisis" caused by "the biggest challenge facing Japan, which is the population aging and low birthrate," as well as security challenges
Abe has been under fire for his connection with nationalist private school operator Moritomo Gakuen, which purchased a piece of state-owned land in Osaka for only a fraction of the market price
He said that he would seek mandate from the people for shifting the usage of part of the revenue generated by a consumption tax hike that has been delayed until 2019 from paying debt to welfare policies
He added that the reason Abe cited for dissolving the lower house is not convincing, and that the prime minister is just trying to avoid further grilling on favoritism scandals
He also said that he would seek public support for a tougher stance over the Korea Peninsula issue
He has also been accused of using his influence to make the government choose Kake Educational Institution, run by a close friend of Abe's, to open a new department in a government- designated special economic zone
Abe's decision to call for a snap election, however, has drawn staunch criticism from opposition parties, which argued that there is no reason to dissolve the lower house of parliament before its current term expires in December 2018
The college, with a transitional campus at Hainan University, will relocate to its permanent campus, which is under construction in Mission Hill in Haikou
"Even the teaching building of HAITC is the same as in Arizona State University in order to enhance students sense of belonging," he said
About one-third of the college's teachers are from Arizona State University and one-third from global recruitment, with others from Hainan University, according to Wang
Li Jianbao, president of Hainan University，said that HAITC is the first domestic Sino-foreign cooperative tourist institution formally approved by the Ministry of Education in May 2017
"Through this partnership, we leverage our two institutions' expertise, resources and passion for community development and public service," Jonathan GS Koppell, dean of ASU College of Public Service and Community Solutions, said
HAITC is an international and innovative joint college established by Hainan University and American top-ranking public research institution, Arizona State University, the first of its kind in China
A total of 268 students majoring in hotel management, human geography and urban/rural planning and administrative management attended the opening ceremony
Hainan University and Arizona State University Joint International Tourism College, which is affiliated with Hainan University, opened its first-ever session in Haikou, capital of China's southern Hainan province, on Monday
The college is aiming to cultivate management personnel with a global vision and international competitiveness of tourism
"This new college is an incredibly exciting and innovative initiative," Koppell said when addressing the opening ceremony on Monday
The students also will have access to the quality teaching, research resources and electronic library resources with ASU, she added
That means that the students can enjoy American top university teaching resources without going abroad, said Wang Lin, head of the new college
With the professional courses taught in English, students will get double degrees, one from Hainan University and another from Arizona State University, if they successfully graduate from the college
Tuition is about 60,000 yuan for each semester, which is much less than that in ASU's US headquarters, while excellent students have the same access to various scholarships
4 magnitude earthquake recorded on Saturday near the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's most recent nuclear test site was "natural"
The test prompted global condemnation, leading the United Nations Security Council to unanimously adopt new sanctions that include restricting the DPRK's oil shipments
The report said the analysis of seismic waves and the lack of sound waves clearly showed the quake was not caused by an artificial explosion, citing an unnamed weather agency official from the ROK
The center previously issued a notice saying it suspected another test because the epicenter was located on the surface
4 magnitude quake would be much smaller than the quakes caused by previous DPRK nuclear tests, the report said
After the incident, the center quickly organized seismological bureaus and geological institutions to evaluate the situation, it said
Seismologists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of California Santa Cruz also published a joint report on Saturday that said tests had shown the quake "clearly falls in the natural phenomena category" and was similar to the last natural earthquake in the region, which was recorded in December 2004
3 magnitude quake, while the strongest, this month, resulted in a 6
"The incident was not a nuclear explosion, but had the characteristics of a natural quake," the China Earthquake Networks Center said late Saturday in a statement released online
"What the concerned parties should do now is to strictly and comprehensively implement UN Security Council resolutions and make positive efforts to resolve the issue through dialogue," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said at a news briefing on Friday
The official Korean Central News Agency claimed it was a hydrogen bomb
DPRK conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test to date on Sept 3
Saturday's earthquake is likely to be a "delayed collapse earthquake", the joint report said, without elaborating on the cause of the quake
The earthquake took place around 4:30 pm near the area of Kilju in the northeastern DPRK, just around 6 kilometers from the Punggye-ri facility where the country held its latest test
The Republic of Korea's weather agency also assessed the quake as natural, The Associated Press reported on Sunday
Kim was the first among the surviving "comfort women", a euphemism for the hundreds of thousands of girls and women in 13 Asia-Pacific countries or regions who were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese army from 1930 to 1954, to go public in front of television cameras about her story in August 1991
"Julie Tang and Lillian Sing, both judges of the Superior Court of San Francisco County who retired two years ago and co-chair the CWJC, vowed to erect more memorials around the United States
However, those who deny history in Japan denigrate them as "paid prostitutes" or "willing volunteers
She had spoken before in front of local and national legislative bodies as well as national and international human rights committees, and to reporters, about presumably the largest-scale crime specifically targeting women in human history
The memorial is a gift from the "Comfort Women" Justice Coalition, or CWJC, a local grassroots advocacy group consisting of more than 30 multi-ethnic community organizations
"It is my soul, it is your soul, and it should be the soul of everybody," she said
It was not the first time for Lee, aged 89, to make such a statement
It was not the first time for Lee, now an activist, to travel around the world to tell people what it means for her to seek justice, especially for those who did not survive to hear a formal apology from the Japanese government
Mary Square in San Francisco, the United States, on Sept 22, 2017
The face of the sculpture depicted Kim Haksoon, a Korean woman forcefully taken at the age of 17 by Japanese soldiers and confined to a "comfort station"
Historians believe that as many as 200,000 women, mostly from the Korean Peninsula as well as from China and Southeast Asian nations, were forced into sex enslavement for Japanese soldiers during the devastating war
Lee followed in June 1992, telling about her sufferings which started at the age of 16
Mary's Square Annex in the city on the US West Coast, Lee witnessed the unveiling of a memorial called the "Comfort Women" Column of Strength on Friday
Mike Honda, a former member of the US House of Representatives, who as the chief sponsor of a July 2007 House resolution urged Japan to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the sexual exploitation of "comfort women," joined elected officials at the event to greet Lee and denounce those who deny history
At the unveiling ceremony, Eric Mar, a former board member who initiated the process, choked back tears when he said that he has a 17-year-old daughter and that Lee's courage to stand up against sexual violence and historical crimes is an inspiration for people fighting for justice
[Photo/Xinhua]SAN FRANCISCO - "I hate the crime, not the people," an emotional Yong-Soo Lee, a Korean woman who survived the sexual slavery by the Imperial Army of Japan during World War II, told a packed audience at a corner of a public square
In a statement released on the occasion, the CWJC said that "through our memorial, we remember all our grandmothers who are alive, and all those who have passed on but are still with us in both spirit and memory
"The unveiling of the "comfort women" memorial, the first in a major city in the United States, which also includes a sculpture of three girls -- Korean, Chinese and Filipino -- took place on the second anniversary of a resolution passed by San Francisco city and the county's legislative Board of Supervisors
Besides calling for putting up the memorial, the resolution aimed at raising public awareness against sex trafficking and all forms of sexual violence
Comfort Women Justice Coalition, a local grassroots advocacy group devoted to bring justice for the victims of Japanese military sexual slavery during the World War II, unveiled a monument dedicated to the "comfort women" in San Francisco on Friday
" However, in the instance of "comfort women," the criminals "went away and got free, there was no justice for the comfort women
Tang told Xinhua that during 26 years as a judge, she had to "make sure in each case that if somebody committed a crime, the person would be held accountable
"Asked what the memorial means for her, Sing pointed at herself and at reporters at a press briefing, saying that it reflects the soul of everybody with a conscience
"A sound wave, which is usually generated in the event of an artificial earthquake, was not detected
The China Earthquake Administration, of which the CENC is a part, and related departments conducted studies on the infrasonic records of the earthquake and previous quakes including those provoked by nuclear tests on the Korean Peninsula
Earlier, South Korea's weather agency said the quake is presumed to have been a natural one, the country's Yonhap news agency reported
They concluded that Saturday's quake is a natural one, the seismic service said
4 on the Richter scale that occurred Saturday in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is not the result of a nuclear test, the China Earthquake Networks Center (CENC) said
"The quake is presumed to have occurred naturally," the report quoted an agency official as saying
The epicenter was roughly the same with a similar shallow earthquake on Sept 3, which turned out to be caused by a nuclear test by the DPRK

Rabbani said the donation will help improve the working conditions of the Pakistani parliament, highlighting the friendship and exchanges between the two countries and two peoples
The handover ceremony was held at the premises of the parliament in the capital Islamabad
The Chinese ambassador said enhancing bilateral exchanges is of great importance to deepen the mutually beneficial cooperation, especially to promote the bilateral policy coordination and people-to-people exchanges
ISLAMABAD - China on Thursday handed over 330 pieces of office equipment including laptops, computers, scanners, printers and projectors to Pakistan's parliament
Pakistani Senate Chairman Mian Raza Rabbani expressed gratitude for China's donation at the ceremony attended also by senators, parliamentarians and other high officials
Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong and Pakistani Senate Secretary Amjed Pervez Malik signed a handover document on behalf of their respective sides
Sun Xinwei, deputy general manager of China State Construction Engineering Corp Central and Western African Region, advised that Chinese companies engaging in any large infrastructure projects in Congo should be aware of expenses for the period after the project is completed and before the official operation, as the Congolese government is suffering from an economic downturn due to oil price drop from 2014, which results in delayed payment
Lyu Xinhua delivers a speech at the conference on investment and trade between China and Congo (Brazzaville), Sept 25, 2017
The delegation consists of entrepreneurs in the sectors of finance, machine-building, energy, agriculture, textile, security, culture and education
"In Cameroon and Cote d'Ivoire, I have reached consensus with the entrepreneurs who have the intent to cooperate with me in textile production and products," he said
"We hope the Congolese enterprises and Chinese enterprises will form a sound cooperation partnership," she said
China is the top trade partner and the largest engineering project contractor of Congo
Zhou Fuming, director general of Suzhou Mike Textile, who has set up a textile and dyeing company in Ethiopia, said that he learned more about Western Africa, the population, the resource and demand so that he would be able to bring Chinese resources to Africa and the Africans' to China
In his speech at the conference, Lyu Xinhua, president of the council, said that the Chinese Council for the Promotion of the South-South Cooperation is willing to provide a platform for the Congolese and Chinese enterprises to exchange information and form partnership
"However, in recent years, the Chinese government no longer tolerates the existence of polluting enterprises," he said
"Some media claim that the Chinese investment would cause pollution in the host country," he said
"He said the reasons to choose Congo for the visit are that Congo boasts a sound investment environment, the infrastructure construction shows a growing momentum and the Chinese enterprises are willing to be involved in the industrialization process of the country
Lyu also eased local worries about the pollution that comes along with industrialization
[Photo by Pan Zhongming/China Daily]Brazzaville, Congo - The Chinese Council for the Promotion of the South-South Cooperation has launched a new wave to explore the French-speaking western African markets in Cameroon, Cote D'Ivoire and Congo (Brazzaville) by leading a 30-odd member delegation of entrepreneurs to visit the countries
Addressing the conference on investment and trade between China and Congo (Brazzaville) on Monday, Annick Patricia Mongo, director general of the Agency for the Promotion of Investment in Congo, said that she hoped Congo could be the country of priority for Chinese entrepreneurs to invest in central Africa
"And we will not allow the overseas projects invested in by Chinese investors to cause pollution
"It was true during the first 30 years of China's opening-up while China was attracting foreign investment, pollution was an issue," he said
First, Congo has set up the Sino-Congolese Bank for Africa (BSCA), a joint venture between the Congolese government and the Agriculture Bank of China; Congo is a portal country to the Western African market, with a deep-water port on the west coast along the Atlantic Ocean; the political situation in Congo is quite stable; the government of Congo approved to promote investment in the country in 2015 and the Agency for the Promotion of Investment in Congo will provide detailed information on investment and opportunities to enter the country
"Besides, the Congolese government can adopt the most strict standards on pollution for the Chinese companies and the Chinese investors will consciously follow the rules and regulations set by the Congolese government, he said
The Special Economic Zone under construction in Pointe Noire is the flagship project of Chinese-Congolese cooperation, Lyu said
He said the visit was quite fruitful thanks to the enthusiasm for cooperation in the western African countries he has visited
"We are glad that the council today meets with the Chinese entrepreneurs to discuss with Congolese counterparts on investment and business partnership," he said, "Congo is the third leg but the most important destination of the visit

China has lifted hundreds of millions of its citizens out of poverty over the past few decades, but doing the same for groups like the Yi poses a different set of challenges
About 775,000 officials have been sent to impoverished areas for poverty relief work, said the report
Similarly, the annual per capita income in impoverished rural areas has grown to 10
To achieve the target, China needs to bring more than 10 million people out of poverty every year, meaning nearly one million people per month or 20 people per minute
9 million people out of poverty each year" (Aug 29, 2017)
China has set 2020 as the target year to complete the building of a "moderately prosperous society," which requires the eradication of poverty

The training course on the Chinese lion dance is part of the 2017 China Africa Cultures in Focus, an activity held by the Bureau for External Cultural Relations of Chinese Ministry of Culture to strengthen the cultural communication between China and African countries
They kept practicing from morning until night, trying to master the basic skills of lion dance, routines and instrumental music within a short period
The cultural center of the Jinpu New Area also arranged some courses for them to know about other traditional Chinese culture such as Chinese calligraphy, seal cutting, folk dance, paper-cutting, and pottery
The cultural center of the Jinpu New Area has undertaken the course for three consecutive years since 2015
During the 35-day training course, they learned from Li Mingxu, the fifth generation successor of the Jinzhou Lion Dance, a provincial intangible cultural heritage that has been passed from generation to generation for more than a century
Ten students from Nigeria and Zambia learned how to perform Chinese lion dance at the Jinpu New Area in Dalian, Northeast China's Liaoning province
These changes may look pleasant, but not quite so to Derek Hyra, an associate professor at the American University School of Public Affairs and an expert on neighborhood change
Chen Weihua/China DailyHaving lived in Washington DC for almost five years, I have seen the city growing, with new construction and renovation projects happening in many streets and neighborhoods
Hyra described how the "dark ghetto" has been turned into a "gilded ghetto"
To Hyra, it has caused not just residential displacement for African Americans but also political and cultural displacement
His book this year, Race, Class, and Politics in the Cappuccino City, is the result of his many years of field research on the issues

The 14th Street near U Street, a traditional African American neighborhood, is now lined up with hip restaurants and bars in this photo taken on Sunday
The area, a 90 percent black neighborhood just a few decades ago, was only 30 percent African American by 2010
Hyra described the massive transformation in the U Street/Shaw area, where the city's once most infamous open-air drug market has become a farmers' market now selling grass-fed beef and homemade duck egg ravioli
The Wharf residential and business project I visited recently is probably one of the biggest
The same urban renewal is happening in other parts of Washington
The U Street/Shaw and 14th Street area has fast been turned into an upscale neighborhood in recent years, with many new restaurants and shops opening and new apartment construction

"An effort to reduce sugary drink intake of teenagers is urgently needed," Liang Xiaofeng, deputy director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said
According to the US Department of Agriculture, global production of sugar is up 9 million tons to a record of 180 million metrics tons a year and consumption hovers at the 172 million metric ton level, also a record high level
The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that people should drink no more than three cans of soda (about 450 calories) a week, but men drink 175 and women 94 calories a day
One sign says you're looking at 45,485 pounds of added sugar - the amount that Kind says children in the United States consume every five minutes
As early as 2006 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified sugar drinks as one of the main culprits in rising obesity rates
The numbers are spun out by Kind from there: children consume 13
"In addition, I have found that sugar imports are increasing
Until the 18th century, when the technology for extracting sugar from cane was developed, and 19th century, when we learned how to get it from beets, sugar was only available when the fruit ripened or the bees got busy
About 12 percent of children aged 7 to 18 in the survey were overweight
Judy Zhu / China DailyA 24-foot-tall pyramid of boxes marked "sugar" in the middle of Times Square makes a point that's kind of hard to ignore
The world does consume too much "added sugar" - a term the USDA began using in 2000 to help people spot processed foods that have added energy with no added nutrition
"Every country that has adopted the Western diet, one dominated by low-cost, highly processed food, has witnessed rising rates of obesity and related diseases," the journal Nature commented recently
High fructose corn syrup, raw, brown and white sugar, honey, maple syrup, molasses make up about 16 percent of the calories Americans consume and have zero nutritional value
As the researchers in Nature put it: "In recent years, sugar has been added to virtually every processed food, limiting consumer choice
5 million children in the US are obese, the CDC says, blaming snacks and foods high in sugar and salt
For children aged four to eight, the AHA suggests no more than three teaspoons of sugar a day, about 130 calories of a 1,600-calorie diet
1 million pounds of added sugar a day - enough to fill 273 yellow school buses
A can of soda has the equivalent of seven to 12 teaspoons of sugar
"A report from a survey of 14 provinces in China found that the daily intake of sugars for Chinese people was lower than the level recommended by the World Health Organization, but for children between the ages of 3 and 17 it was much higher because of the growing popularity of sugary drinks, China Daily reported in May
A display in Times Square includes a sugar tower that is 15 feet wide by 24 feet high
It is made of cartons depicting more than 45,000 pounds of sugar, surrounded by life-size models of "crystallized" children
The top domestic consumers, in descending order, are India, the EU, China, the US and Brazil
Standing sentinel around the mound are ghostly sculptures of small children, apparently made out of sugar-like granular material, wearing tags that read: "I am 9 years old and weigh 64 pounds
According to the National Soft Drink Association, the industry produces 600 12-ounce cans of sugary drinks per person per year, most of it what they call the full-sugar variety, and supplies more than a quarter of what Americans drink
The publicity stunt, created by Magnetic Collaborative agency to promote power bar-maker Kind's new line of fruit snacks, which have no added sugar, is meant to sound an alarm
In descending order, Brazil, India, the EU, Thailand, China and the US are the top producers
The survey, conducted in 2014 by China's health, education and sports authorities, found that the sugar intake of males 13 to 17 surpassed 8
"There are now 30 percent more people who are obese than who are undernourished
The average child takes in 21 teaspoons a day, the AHA says
The white paper went to great lengths to define China as one of the "destabilizing factors" along with Democratic People's Republic of Korea
It highlighted "more tangible" and "acute" challenges and destabilizing factors
The legislation provides greater flexibility, responsiveness, and interoperability for training, exercises, and planning on a broader spectrum of security issues by easing restrictions on Japanese Self-Defense Force operations, including the ability to exercise collective self-defense
This will empower Japan to be an active player at the region and global stages
The white paper, the first after Japan's security legislation went into effect in March, played up the so-called "gray zone" situations, or neither pure peacetime nor contingencies over territory, sovereignty and economic interests
In its 2016 defense white paper, Japan interferes in the South China Sea
The white paper served as an implementation scheme for the controversial security bills that enable Japan's Self-Defense Forces to play a more comprehensive global military role and allow implementation of the new US and Japan alliance guidelines
It made irresponsible accusations against China, claiming that China continues to act in an "assertive" manner, including attempts at changing the status quo by coercion
cn]On August 2, Japanese government approved this year's version of defense white paper, which described the security environment surrounding the country "increasingly severe"
China's "dangerous acts" in the South China Sea and East China Sea could cause unintended consequences
(To overblow Chinese ship's entry, Japan's foreign ministry summoned Chinese Ambassador to Japan Cheng Yonghua in the tee hours of that day, and lodged a protest
)Refusing to have a territorial dispute in the East China Sea, Japan is unlikely to talk with China over its settlement, leaving the waters near the islands a minefield
The Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer Hatakaze quickly followed them into that area
In response to the Hatakaze's entry, the Chinese Jiangkai I-class frigate rushed into the waters, according to the Japanese weekly Nikkei Asian Review
Hiding the first part of the episode, the white paper criticized China for its frigate's entry into Japan's "contiguous" zone near the disputed islets in the East China Sea
On June 8, three Russian naval ships entered the waters close to the Diaoyu Islands
The defense legislation eliminates geographic constraints by substituting a situational threshold (situations that "gravely affect the peace and stability of Japan") rather than limiting support to "situations in areas surrounding Japan"
Iowa's ties with China had already shown signs of increasing
Even though Iowa is best known for its agricultural products and services, Reynolds said that advanced manufacturing is "actually the largest sector of our GDP
Reynolds said last month when announcing the trip that "there is no better time than now to market and pitch our products in China
"We believe as a united Iowa agricultural delegation, we can find opportunities that are beneficial to both China and Iowa," Reynolds said
According to Allen Williams, the business development manager at the Iowa Economic Development Authority, the state has had more inquiries from China in recent months than in the previous two or three years
Our relationship with the country is strong, and their growing middle class means increasing purchasing power, and Iowa stands to gain significantly as a result
US beef had been banned from China since 2003 due to a mad cow disease scare
" When Branstad was receiving a Chinese trade delegation as Iowa governor in March, he remarked that he would like to be able to enjoy a bite of US beef at the US embassy in Beijing
Meetings are planned for the delegation with Chinese government officials, industry partners and Branstad in Beijing, Shanghai and Xi'an, Shaanxi province
Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds is leading a trade mission to China that will feature officials from groups representing the state's major agricultural producers
Reynolds, who succeeded Terry Branstad as governor when he became the US ambassador to China on May 22, noted that agricultural "is the backbone of Iowa's economy and contributes about $112 billion to our economy annually"
"Relationships are especially important in China, and we are fortunate that Governor Branstad welcomed a then local agricultural official from China over 30 years ago into Iowa named Xi Jinping, who is now the nation's president," said Reynolds
Last year, nearly $6 billion worth of US pork was exported to China, including more than $1 billion from Iowa
"We will have representatives from our corn, soybean, beef, egg, poultry, dairy and turkey sectors seeking an opportunity to expand their footprint in China as the country's middle class grows," Reynolds said of the 10-day trip, which began on Wednesday
His wish came true on June 30 in Beijing when Branstad had prime rib from Nebraska to celebrate the return of US beef to China after 13 years
It detailed how one particular photograph in the series depicted the daughter of the famous Chinese statesman, Zeng Guofan
The story about a collection of rare photographs of Beijing from the late 1800s, on show in London's Chinatown, included a number of images from the exhibit - one of which set Watt back on his heels
The article explained how British photographer, Thomas Child, who had moved to China as an engineer, captured marriage ceremonies during the late Qing dynasty - which spanned from 1644 to 1912
"The display of Child's work at the China Exchange, an organization in London, was the first time US-based collector, Stephan Loewentheil, had shared the original images of life during the Qing dynasty in Peking, now known as Beijing
"The family rose in importance in Shanghai from the late Qing dynasty into the twentieth century and went through more than 70 years of ups and downs until 1950," he said
While Watt's reaction to the never-before-seen photographs was by far the most compelling, the exhibition in Soho's Gerrard Street attracted worldwide attention, making headlines in the UK, the US, Europe and China
"The success of the show reflected the increasing global interest in China's people and culture, as well as the interest of the people of China in preserving and studying their own history," said Loewentheil, who's Historical Photography of China Collection is the largest holding of late Qing dynasty photographs of China in private hands
"My great, great grandfather was Zeng Guofan," Watt said
The 79-year-old never expected when he was browsing the internet that day that he would uncover a piece of family history dating back some 140 years
"It was a picture I had never seen before and my instinct told me that the subjects could be my great grandparents," he told China Daily
According to Watt, the unique wedding photograph documents the moment of the start of the prominent Nie family in China
"The groom, Nie Jigui, served as Shanghai's Governor from 1890 to 1893, died in 1911 and was buried in Hunan, while the bride, Zeng Jifen, died in 1942 and was buried in Shanghai
Not to mention, in an exhibition some 3,500 miles away from where he lived
Portrait of a womanWhen New York-based Raymond Watt came across an article on the BBC news website about a Chinese photography exhibition in the UK last November, he was shocked, to say the least
"Today, Beijing is a vastly different place and the early photographs presented a perspective on the city which had never been previously available
The country, which gained independence from the United Kingdom in April 1961, remains one of the least developed in the world
It has eight surgical operation rooms and 300 patient beds

File photo shows Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte supporters gather during a vigil backing the anti-drugs crackdown at the Luneta park in metro Manila, Philippines February 25, 2017
Philippine law enforcers seized the drugs around midnight and it took less than four hours for the cross-border operation to be implemented
Noting that the anti-drug cooperation between China and the Philippines has gone through a long history and achieved fruitful results, the two sides said the current cooperation has entered an increasingly good period
With regard to the May 25 bust of a drug trafficking ring and seizure of 604 kilograms of crystal meth, according to the meeting, the Chinese Customs officials discovered the attempt to smuggle the illegal drugs into the Philippines
The Chinese officials were from China's National Narcotics Control Commission and Ministry of Public Security while Philippine officials were from Philippines' Dangerous Drugs Board and Bureau of Customs
The comments and pledge came as officials from the two countries met here recently on the sidelines of the 11th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Transnational Crimes
[Photo/Agencies]MANILA - China and the Philippines have fully affirmed the positive results achieved so far in their anti-drug cooperation, vowing to further strengthen their cooperation in this regard in the future
It was found out that the drugs have been delivered to the Philippines and the Chinese officials immediately informed their Philippine counterparts, alerting them about the drug shipment
The Chinese side reiterated that like the current Philippine government, the Chinese government maintains "zero tolerance" policy on illicit drugs, calling on the two sides to further enhance and strengthen collaborative efforts to bust drug smugglers
The two sides refuted distorted reports recently published by certain media, stressing that the fake news were neither in the interests of bilateral anti-drug cooperation, nor in the interests of the two peoples
According to the meeting, real-time intelligence sharing, coordination, drug rehabilitation are just some of the practices that both countries are looking at in their anti-drug cooperation
China will also be contributing technical expertise and equipment in the future

I think China should attract even more foreigners, because from my own experience, having a look at the real China, not just the view from overseas, makes a big difference
"He wanted to go to the inland provinces, and he had some knowledge of Anhui, so he chose Hefei as his destination," Cho said
It was the first primary school in the country to do so
It also extends to boosting Sino-South Korean economic ties and helping the province's poverty-stricken areas
We didn't expect that we would come to love the country as much as we do," said Cho, who speaks fluent Mandarin
Over the last 21 years, South Korean teacher Cho Sung-hye has contributed much to the friendship between the people of her country and China
"China is developing very fast and will play more important roles in the world
The improvement of the people's confidence itself is one of the biggest achievements
"Nowadays, flights connecting Hefei with Incheon in South Korea are available five days a week, and the situation is improving
A teacher of Korean at Hefei University in Anhui province, Cho has helped to boost the two countries' ties in multiple aspects - not just in education
The two countries must promote cooperation in many areas, but how can cooperation go well if our next generation doesn't understand Chinese?" Cho asked
In 2002, she became the first person from her country to receive China's Friendship Award, the highest honor given to foreigners by the central government
Cho's reputation is not limited to education, however
Before they became major officials, dozens of years should have passed and they should have collected enough experience to tackle seemingly tough problems
In the runup to the meeting, China Daily asked a prominent South Korean teacher to talk about her experiences in promoting educational improvements, business cooperation and people-to-people understanding in her native country and her adopted home
It was unforgettable because my family watched the relay in South Korea in 1988 but didn't get the chance to participate
What are your expectations for the upcoming 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China? What are the key issues you care about most? I think China loves peace more than some of the developed countries
She has helped more than 3,000 students from Anhui to study in her country, and more than 1,000 were given job opportunities there
"At the peak, I had 21 relatives living here, and there are still 12 of them now," Cho said
I was one of the torchbearers for the Beijing Olympic Games torch relay in Hefei in 2008
Dozens of universities are located here, including the University of Science and Technology of China, one of the country's best," she said
More policies should also be made to attract more foreign talent to work in China
"There were even South Korean businessmen who intended to invest in Hefei but decided to invest in Shanghai and Nanjing instead, as they found the two cities to be more developed," she added
How to make the other countries believe a rapidly developing China is not a threat is really a tough issue
And she has brought even more students from South Korea to China
"In the past 21 years, I have witnessed great development achievements in China, and I believe the five years to come after the pending 19th CPC National Congress will bring the country a more prosperous future
She also serves as an economic counselor for the Hefei Economic and Technological Development Area, where Hefei University is based, and the Hefei High-Tech Industry Development Zone
The younger one attended Anhui University of Chinese Medicine and earned bachelor's and master's degrees there
When we were living in a community about 10 kilometers away, we could seldom see the hill from the window
What's the most memorable experience you've had in China, or related to China? Unforgettable experiences in China are many
Within a year, she moved to the city with her husband, Park Nam-gyu, and her sons
The latest example was a 2016 donation of 20,000 yuan ($3,000) to four high school graduates in Hefei's Feidong county who had been enrolled at universities but were about to give up for lack of money
I hope it can play a more important role in world peace in the future
The couple found employment quickly at Hefei University and began teaching Korean the next year
The university was the first in the province to have such a course
Travelers had to change flights in Shanghai or Nanjing, Jiangsu province
I don't believe the Western countries' political practices could work in China, though many of them are considered successful by the Westerners themselves
One of the results is that the Chinese people are more confident than ever about their country's development
After about a year in Hefei, Park took a job in the United States and tried to persuade Cho to give up Hefei
Before coming to China as an adult, she worked at Soon Chun Hyang University as a teacher
President Xi puts a lot of emphasis on environmental protection
Impressed by how the history teacher had influenced her son, Cho has encouraged Chinese students to go to South Korea
"When the eldest of my two sons was in the third year of middle school, his history teacher, who had some experience in China, suggested the students go to live there and have a close look at the old country," Cho said
Letting them work here can make better use of their contribution, and also working in a country can give the foreigners more opportunities to develop a more profound understanding of the country
In the urban area of Hefei, there is a hill called Dashu Hill
What's the biggest challenge China faces, and how do you think the country should go about overcoming it? The biggest challenge could come from the changes
"Nowadays all the primary schools in my country have made Chinese-language courses available to students," said Cho, who was believed by some local media to have given the strongest push to the achievement
Editor's Note: The Communist Party of China will hold its 19th National Congress on Oct 18
And she was the first South Korean citizen to gain permanent residency in China in 2006
"Now I often accompany Hefei officials to South Korea for business recruitment and students for educational exchanges," Cho said
In recent years, I have received numerous awards from the Chinese government
I believe that in the coming five years, the gap between coastal and inland regions will be narrowed
"My husband and I came to China - to Hefei - to fulfill my elder son's dream
In 2000, with Cho's help, the Banyang Elementary School - in which she had studied - began teaching Chinese
Cho's brothers and sisters also brought their children to Hefei
cn &#160;Cho Sung-hye talks with her students at Hefei University in Anhui province
A remarkable South Korean teacher took up residence in Hefei, Anhui province, at the urging of her young son and never looked back
What do you think China will be like in five years' time? How do you view China's longer-term future? Chinese people's incomes have increased significantly in recent years and they will become richer in the next five years
He has been trying his best to achieve what he has vowed to do
To better promote the educational exchanges, Cho and her husband founded the Handa Cultural Exchange Co in Hefei in 2006, with Cho as president
She has played a prominent role in education, business development and friendship
Opening up to the world has brought dramatic changes to the coastal regions, which have been more developed that the inland areas
" What do you feel has been China's biggest achievement over the past five years? What's the most notable change you've observed? China has achieved much in many aspects over the last five years
In 1998, when she was back in her hometown, Cho delivered a three-hour speech to 82 heads of primary schools, trying to persuade them to offer Chinese courses
In 2010, she was listed as one of the most influential women of the century in Hefei
Officials should all start from basic positions and get promotions gradually
Half a year later, Park returned to Hefei University and has been there ever since
"In the early years, transportation between Hefei and South Korea was not convenient
"In the five years since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, China has invested more than ever before in poverty relief, and President Xi Jinping has vowed to eliminate poverty by 2020," Cho noted
Some of the South Korean companies based in the two zones, the largest in the province, were attracted through Cho's efforts
The boy - a great fan of Chinese history who was able to give the names of more than 900 figures in the Chinese classic Romance of Three Kingdoms - was inspired and wanted very much to follow the suggestion
Do you believe that some of China's experiences or practices could be used to solve pressing global problems? If so, what are they? China has a very mature and comprehensive system to foster leadership
What three words would you use to describe China today? Revitalizing, changing, confident
Cho said the number of the poverty-stricken students is declining, and they can now get more financial support from the government, rather than relying on occasional social donations
It's hard to make long-term predictions, but I hope China can keep its own development pace and have its own development patterns
China is a big country, so officials have to collaborate with each other well
" Cho and her husband have also donated hundreds of thousands of yuan to help prevent the children of poverty-stricken rural families in Anhui from dropping out of school
Also, Xi has been very good at choosing the right people to work with him
I became the first South Korean person to receive the Chinese Central Government's Friendship Award in 2002 and the first from my country to get permanent residency in China in 2006
She herself knew little of the province or its capital at that time, so she decided to have a look before taking her family there
"On the visit to Hefei, I found it was not very developed but thought it would have great potential
For the last five years, the air has been clearing up
"I told him that we had just started here and we should at least spend five years in the city before judging whether we should move to another place," Cho said
First, China is playing an increasingly important role in the world, so some neighboring countries, and especially some developed Western countries may regard China as a challenger to the power they have maintained for many years
Some of China's practices are also worth learning, such as how it trains its officials
She is now helping the development area build a China-South Korea Industry Park, and she has already brought in three South Korean companies to invest in the city's high-tech zone
What is your impression of President Xi Jinping? I think he is a determined man
After finishing middle school and high school studies in the city, Cho's elder son was admitted to Peking University for undergraduate studies, and then returned to Hefei later for his MBA at the University of Science and Technology of China
The Obama administration had done everything it could to internationalize the South China Sea issue and had used the Philippines, a US ally, to advance the American strategy
However, the Pew survey finds that Duterte and his policies are widely popular at home despite concerns expressed by some governments, in particular the US, over Duterte's clashes with drug cartels and alleged human rights violations
A quarter now name China as the world's leading economy, up from 14 percent the last time the Philippines was surveyed
At the same time, 78 percent believe the current economic situation is good, and 57 percent are satisfied with the direction of the country, a 21 percentage-point increase from 2014, the last time this question was asked in the Philippines
And despite the Philippines being the most pro-Trump nation in Pew's spring 37-country survey, confidence in Trump now is lower than it was in then-President Barack Obama in 2015
The Philippines under Duterte has tried to develop an independent foreign policy rather than being a US puppet most of the time
Since becoming Philippines president in June 2016, Rodrigo Duterte has refused to be used by the US to advance its strategy
That was certainly not the policy under Obama when he launched the US pivot-to-Asia policy, trying to gang up US allies on China
And on global economic status, about half of Filipinos (49 percent) say that the US is still the leading economic power, but that is down from 66 percent who said so in 2015
The survey released on Sept 21 bore a title saying people in the Philippines still favor the United States over China, but that the gap is narrowing
This represents a dramatic shift since that question was last asked in 2015
Such an independent policy is dealing a heavy blow to those who still view the relationship between the three countries as zero-sum
Some even believe that he would not able to serve the full six-year term
And overall, the perception gap between the US and China in the Philippines is narrowing
It clearly suggests that one's gain is another's loss
Meanwhile, two-thirds say having a strong economic relationship with China is more important for ties between the two nations, while only 28 percent say being tough with China on territorial disputes is more vital
His tough rhetoric on the US and softened rhetoric on China, especially compared with his predecessor Aquino III, has worried many in the US
The report finds that people in the Philippines still like the US and have confidence in its leader, President Donald Trump
The US was believed to be fully behind the scenes when the Philippines, under President Benigno Aquino III, filed the arbitration suit in 2013 against China in a tribunal in The Hague, a case in which China had refused to participate
By comparing these figures, Pew seems to suggest that China and the US are engaging in a popularity contest in the Philippines
A zero-sum mentality about China-US relations is reflected not only in the thinking of some US politicians, but also in a new survey conducted by the Pew Research Center
According to the survey, 78 percent in the Philippines have a positive view of the US as of this spring, down from 92 percent who expressed positive sentiments in 2015
The US government, lawmakers and pundits have generally expressed negative views of Duterte since he took office last June
But Filipinos also share positive views of China and its leader, President Xi Jinping
Fully 86 percent have a favorable view of Duterte himself; 78 percent support his handling of the illegal-drugs issue; and 62 percent say that the Philippines government is making progress in its anti-drug campaign
In 2014, the Philippines was still led by Aquino III
But the Philippines, and indeed all the countries in the region, should be encouraged to have good relations with both China and the US, a real win-win situation for not just the three countries involved, but for the region and the world
AUCKLAND - New Zealand's parliamentary elections on Saturday yield no clear winner as tally ended in the wee hours of Sunday, leaving the third largest party with 7
The negotiations may take days or weeks before a deal is struck between the future governing partners
Winston Peters, the party chief of the New Zealand First Party, however, refused to say which party he would side with
8 percent votes or seven seats in the congress would just make enough seats to form a government if they can successfully get the New Zealand First Party on board
The New Zealand First Party has garnered nine seats, making it the indispensable coalition partner for both the National Party and the Labor Party to form the government
The ruling National Party has secured 46 percent of the party votes, which transfer to 58 seats in the 120 member Congress in an Mixed-Member Proportional voting system, with the opposition Labor Party lagging behind at 35
BEIJING - China on Friday urged all relevant parties to avoid any action that may increase tension on the Korean Peninsula after the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said it might test a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean
"Only if all sides bear their due responsibilities, can the peninsula nuclear issue be truly resolved and peace and stability restored to the region
"The DPRK knows well that China opposes its development of nuclear weapons and nuclear tests, Lu said
"What parties concerned should do now is to strictly and comprehensively implement UN Security Council resolutions and make positive efforts to resolve the issue through dialogue
"The current situation on the peninsula is severe and complicated," Foreign Minister spokesperson Lu Kang said at a daily press briefing
The minister said that if there is any change needed, it is the denuclearization of the peninsula, and that would be more comprehensive, thorough and irreversible
"Whatever changes may take place, no matter how long it will take, and whatever difficulties we may face, China will stay firmly committed to denuclearizing the peninsula and moving toward talks," he said
Kono said Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs have posed a practical threat to regional peace as well as Japan's security
"We call upon the US to honor its 'Four Nos' commitment, and we call upon all parties to play a constructive role in easing tensions," Wang said
"We urge the DPRK not to go further on along a dangerous direction," Wang said
If Japan only discusses sanctions in the absence of dialogue, and even resists dialogue, it will be considered as violating the resolutions
"There is still hope for peace, we must not give up," Wang said during his speech at the UN General Assembly on Thursday
Twelve years have passed since a joint statement was issued from the Six-Party Talks, signed on Sept 19, 2005, Wang said, but things that follow the progressive trend of the times never become outdated and decisions on the right side of history never become obsolete
"There should be no new nuclear weapons state, whether it is in the north or south of the peninsula, whether it is in Northeast Asia or other parts of the world," Wang added
Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged Pyongyang not to go further in a dangerous direction, and said there should be no new nuclear state in either of the Koreas or elsewhere
Wang said sanctions and peace talks are both part of the Security Council resolutions
The remarks came as rhetoric and even personal name-calling has flared up in recent days between Washington and Pyongyang
He said Japan is willing to push forward denuclearization on the peninsula with China and other parties
"We hope Japan will behave with caution and play a constructive role on the peninsula nuclear issue, rather than the opposite," he said
According to Wang, China is always a force for peace and has made unremitting efforts toward the peaceful settlement of the peninsula nuclear issue
The "Four Nos" refer to Washington's promise not to seek a regime change in Pyongyang, not to seek the collapse of the DPRK government, not to seek acceleration of reunification of the Korean Peninsula, and not to send its military north of the 38th parallel, which acts as the boundary between Pyongyang and Seoul
Wang also met with his Japanese counterpart, Taro Kono, on Thursday in New York

Liu said the two countries, treating each other as good neighbors, friends, brothers and partners, have had fruitful cooperation in all fields since China and Cambodia established diplomatic ties 59 years ago
Xinhua &#160;Liu Yunshan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Samdech Techo Hun Sen, Cambodian prime minister, attend a ceremony where several bilateral cooperative agreements were signed on Wednesday in Phnom Penh
Cambodia will work with China to push forward their bilateral comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership for more development, while maintaining mutual support on each other's issues of crucial concern, Hun Sen said
Hun Sen thanked Liu for the visit ahead of the 19th CPC National Congress, saying it shows China's great attention to the development of Cambodia-China relations
Liu Yunshan, a senior Communist Party of China official, met on Wednesday with Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen in Phnom Penh, and they agreed to cement bilateral cooperation and party-to-party exchanges
The ties between the CPC and the ruling Cambodian People's Party, whose president is Hun Sen, play a leading role in state-to-state ties, said Liu, expecting the two parties to maintain high-level contacts, learn from each other on party rule and state governance, and deepen exchanges to drive party-to-party ties to a new high
China always regards Cambodia as a priority in its diplomacy with neighboring countries, said Liu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee
China will work with Cambodia to implement the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and Hun Sen, and to consolidate mutual political trust and comprehensively deepen strategic cooperation, he said

The document was struck by China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the United States, the Republic of Korea (ROK), Russia and Japan during the fourth round of the six-party talks
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang made the remarks at a routine press briefing, saying China is open to all efforts that are conducive to solving the issue peacefully via political and diplomatic means
In return, the United States promised not to use nuclear weapons or conventional weapons to attack or invade the DPRK
In the statement, the DPRK reaffirmed its commitment to abandoning nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs
"We believe if the parties concerned can adhere to those consensus, abide by the spirit of the joint statement and seek ways to address the reasonable concerns of concerned parties, we will find a way out," said the spokesperson
Lu said the parties concerned should learn from experience in reaching the agreement, which includes holding that the core of the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue is over security issues, the key lies with the United States and the DPRK, and concerns of all parties should be resolved in a balanced way
BEIJING -- China said Tuesday that the six-party talks are still an efficient platform to address the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue
Launched in 2003, the six-party talks were suspended in December 2008
Lu said the joint statement, signed on Sept 19, 2005, is the most important progress in addressing the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue through negotiations, and is of milestone significance
China also proposed a dual-track approach to denuclearization on the peninsula on the one hand and establishing a peace mechanism on the other
China has put forward the "double suspension" proposal, which requires the DPRK to suspend its missile and nuclear activities in exchange for the suspension of large-scale US-ROK military drills

Abe, who also heads the LDP, is set to provisionally dissolve the lower chamber of Japan's bicameral system of parliament on Sept 28, as this is when the extraordinary Diet session will be convened, according to LDP sources close to the matter
However, the prime minister has the authority to dissolve the lower chamber and call a general election at will
This scenario would see official campaigning for the national poll kick off on Oct 10, with voters thereafter casting their ballots on Oct 22
A lower house election must be held by December 2018 as this is when the four-year terms of current lower house lawmakers expire
If Abe goes ahead with his plan to call a snap election, then three by-elections that have been slated to take place on Oct 22 would be replaced by the general election
The opposition camp, however, has criticized Abe's move to call a snap election, with some accusing him of merely trying to escape from the influence-peddling scandals he is currently implicated in and engineering his stay in power
"Nikai on Tuesday, during a meeting of ruling LDP executives reportedly conveyed Abe's intentions and relayed the party's determination to get all of its candidates fielded in the race
Prior to Abe's departure Monday for a five-day trip to New York to attend the UN General Assembly, Abe told Nikai during a meeting that he "will decide on the timing of the snap election after returning from the UN General Assembly on Friday
Abe last dissolved the lower house of parliament in November 2014 and thereafter led the ruling coalition to a sweeping victory in the following election in December
In addition, the fact that new opposition parties in the process of being formed will not have time to organize themselves and mount a serious challenge to Abe and the LDP in such a short space of time, has made many political watchers question Abe's regard for democracy and the will of the people
TOKYO - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is gearing up to dissolve the lower house of parliament and call a snap general election, Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Secretary General Toshihiro Nikai confirmed on Tuesday
The support rate for Abe's cabinet has improved moderately recently, and the opposition camp has accused the prime minister of taking advantage of this and have slammed the possible general election as being unnecessary and serving Abe's personal, not political objectives
The application for UNESCO heritage status submitted by more than 10 groups from China, the Republic of Korea and other countries and regions will "allow the world to fully understand the brutality of the war of agrression, remember history, cherish peace and defend human dignity," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said at a regular news briefing
BEIJING -- Japan should act correctly towards an application for records of comfort women to be listed as UNESCO heritage, instead of threatening not to pay its UNESCO membership fees, a Chinese spokesperson said Monday
If the submitted documents are approved for the UNESCO Memory of the World Register next month, domestic pressure for Japan to cancel payment of its UNESCO membership fees will grow, according to Japanese media
"The members of international organizations are obliged to pay their membership fees on time and in full
China demands Japan reflect on its history of aggression, and take a correct attitude towards and do not smear or meddle with the application," Lu said
The move serves the purposes of the UNESCO, he said
Forceful recruitment of comfort women, or sex slaves, was a grave crime committed by the Japanese militarism during WWII
There is solid evidence and no room for denying that, Lu said
He said that Japan should handle the issue properly and in a responsible way to gain trust from its Asian neighbors and the international community
People from the DPRK and the ROK belong to the same ethnic group, and China has always supported the two countries in strengthening exchanges, improving ties and promoting reconciliation, he said
Lu's comment came after ROK President Moon Jae-in suggested that his country could go ahead with humanitarian aid to the DPRK "regardless of political situations," despite Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's request for consideration of the timing of the proposed aid
BEIJING -- China hopes that concerned parities can understand and respect the emotions of the people and support normal exchanges between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Republic of Korea (ROK), Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said Monday
"All the UN Security Council resolutions that imposed sanctions on the DPRK, including the newly adopted Resolution 2375, have stated clearly that they are not intended to have a negative effect on the livelihoods and humanitarian needs of the people there," Lu said at a daily press briefing
"I think this is not only good for China, but will also be a positive influence to the whole international system," he said
For example, Singapore can become a launchpad for Chinese companies to march into international markets, and they can make the best of Singapore's trade and service facilities as a financial center and transport hub
Singapore's cooperation with China concerning the Belt and Road Initiative, Lee said, is focused on infrastructure inter-connectivity, financial projects and third-country programs such as personnel training, which Singapore believes can combine advantages of both sides
The two sides are expected to exchange views on bilateral ties and issues of common concern, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced Friday
In the interview, Lee said the Initiative-related cooperation in sectors such as infrastructure investments, trade and tourism can help further "integrate China into regional and international economic systems while greatly boosting the prosperity and development in other countries
The Belt and Road Initiative, put forward by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, is aimed at building the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road through concerted efforts of all related countries to benefit all participants by promoting unimpeded trade, financial integration, infrastructure inter-connectivity and closer people-to-people exchanges
The Singaporean leader will pay an official visit to China on Sept 19-21 at the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang
"The Initiative will help foster closer cooperation among China and its neighboring countries as well as its trade partners in Europe, Asia and even Africa," he added
"We deem the Belt and Road Initiative as positive," Lee said Saturday in an interview with Xinhuanet, Xinhua's official website, noting that China's continuous economic growth has made China an increasingly larger and more important part in the international system
SINGAPORE -- Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said that the Belt and Road Initiative of China is positive to the world since it can help further integrate China into regional and international economic systems while boosting growth in other countries
" In his opinion, the Initiative can help China make more and better contributions to global economic and trade cooperation as well as the international relations
One option is to hold a snap election on Oct 22, when three by-elections are scheduled, the sources said
TOKYO - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is considering calling a snap election for as early as next month to take advantage of his improved approval ratings and disarray in the main opposition party, government and ruling party sources said on Sunday
Other possibilities are later in October or after an expected visit by US President Donald Trump in early November
"Until now, it appeared the election would be next autumn, but
Abe's ratings have recovered to 50 percent in some polls
we must always be ready for battle," domestic media quoted Komeito party chief Natsuo Yamaguchi as telling reporters on Saturday during a visit to Russia
Abe told executives of his Liberal Democratic Party and its junior coalition partner, the Komeito party, that he might dissolve parliament's lower house for a snap poll after the legislature convenes for an extra session from Sept 28, the sources said
Abe will probably make a decision after returning from a Sept 18-22 trip to the United States, the sources said
Top LDP and Komeito officials will meet on Monday to discuss preparations, they added
"We need to be clear that the latest UN resolution not only sanctions the DPRK's nuclear activities but also calls for the reopening of dialogue and resolving the issue through consultations," Cui said
"Without implementing these, we also will consider it as noncompliance with the resolution," Nebenzia said, Reuters reported
China's envoy to Washington has urged the US to do more to resolve the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula, while stressing that the UN resolution on Pyongyang also calls for dialogue and peace talks
The ambassador's remarks followed shortly after the DPRK's latest missile launch drew condemnation from the United Nations and refueled fiery rhetoric about a military option from the Trump administration, which also asked China to mount pressure on the DPRK, partly by cutting oil shipments to Pyongyang
"At the UN's headquarters in New York on Friday, Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia also called on the US and others to implement the "political and diplomatic solutions" that are called for in the latest sanctions resolution
Cui said the resolution is a shared responsibility for all parties
The UN Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 2375 on Sept 11 in response to the DPRK's sixth nuclear test, conducted on Sept 3
"Everybody else will have to do their share; they cannot leave this issue to China alone," Cui said at a reception on Friday night in Washington
Cui: United Nations resolution also calls for dialogue Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai
"Cui, however, bluntly said that China will never recognize the DPRK as a nuclear state and opposes nuclear weapons anywhere on the Korean Peninsula and beyond, including Japan and Taiwan
Instead, it should do more to find effective ways to resume dialogue and negotiations, Cui said
Hours after the Democratic People's Republic of Korea launched another missile over Japan into the Pacific Ocean on Friday, Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai said Washington "should be doing much more than now", so that there's real, effective international cooperation on the Korean Peninsula issue
When asked about the oil cuts, Ambassador Cui told reporters, "We are fully prepared to implement all the Security Council resolutions－no more, no less
China responded by saying that it has done its best, and the initiators of a problem should resolve it, said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying
"The resolution should be implemented comprehensively
However, the crisis on the Korean Peninsula has spilled over and endangered regional security and stability, as well as relations between other countries
Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia also warned that there is no alternative to a peaceful solution
Trump tweeted earlier this month that the United States is considering "stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea
"Threats, tests, launches, mutual threats should be stopped
Since then, Pyongyang has conducted its most powerful nuclear test, threatened to fire missiles into the waters around the US pacific island territory of Guam and launched two missiles over Japan
Tekeda Alemu, Ethiopian ambassador to the United Nations and the president of UN Security Council for the month of September, addresses a press encounter after UN Security Council closed-door consultations at the UN headquarters in New York, on Sept 15, 2017
In a press statement released on Friday after closed-door consultations, the 15 members of the council condemned "the highly provocative launch of a ballistic missile" by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
The DPRK fired a missile over Japan's northern island Hokkaido and into the Pacific Ocean on Friday, which came only days after the Security Council voted in favor of a resolution toughening sanctions on the DPRK over its nuclear test early this month
"The Security Council also emphasized the vital importance of the DPRK immediately showing a sincere commitment to denuclearization through concrete action, and stressed the importance of working to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula," said Tekeda Alemu, president of the Security Council, in a readout of the press statement
The council members stressed the importance of maintaining peace on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia at large, and welcomed international efforts to facilitate a peaceful and comprehensive settlement of the crisis through dialogue, said Alemu, the Ethiopian ambassador to the United Nations
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula escalated recently after US President Donald Trump threatened to deal with the DPRK with "fire and fury" last month
[Photo/Xinhua]UNITED NATIONS - The United Nations Security Council has condemned the latest missile launch by Pyongyang and urged a peaceful solution to the crisis on the Korean Peninsula
We should engage in meaningful negotiations," he told reporters after the consultations
"Chinese ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai said Friday "both China and the United States benefit from bilateral trade, so efforts to undermine Sino-US trade, or even slapping sanctions on China, I think would be off-target
To ease tensions, China has been committed to a peaceful solution by supporting Security Council sanctions on one hand, and on the other proposing initiatives which aim to suspend hostilities by both Pyongyang and Washington
The ambassador said the US should refrain from issuing more threats
Instead, Washington should do more to find effective ways to resume dialogue and negotiations
cn]The United States should do more to resolve the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula than it has, Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai said on Friday
Cui made the remarks on the sidelines of a reception at the embassy in Washington to mark the 68th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China
The UN Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 2375 on Monday to respond to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's sixth nuclear test, conducted on Sept 3
"We are fully prepared to implement all the Security Council resolutions, no more, no less," Cui said, adding that China expects other relevant parties to do the same
The ambassador also said China will never recognize the DPRK as a nuclear state and opposes nuclear weapons anywhere on the Korean Peninsula
"Honestly, I think the United States should be doing … much more than now, so that there's real effective international cooperation on this issue," Cui said
"Everybody else will have to do their share; they cannot leave this issue to China alone," Cui said
The ambassador said China has done its best to implement the UN Security Council resolutions in a strict and full fashion, while pushing for relevant parties to resolve problems through peaceful negotiations
"China is not the driver behind the escalation of the tensions
All relevant parties should remain calm and avoid actions that intensify tensions," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said after Pyongyang fired a ballistic missile that flew over northern Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean earlier in the day
"It's irresponsible and unhelpful for the settlement of the issue to unjustly blame others and shirk responsibilities in any form," she added
The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Pyongyang's latest missile launch on Friday, at the request of the US and Japanese delegations, days after it unanimously adopted a new resolution imposing more sanctions over Pyongyang's Sept 3 nuclear test
Shi Yongming, a researcher at the China Institute of International Relations, said the US never tries to determine what its own problem is, but insists on blaming China for the current tensions
"The current situation on the Korean Peninsula is complicated, sensitive and severe
Beijing expressed its opposition to Pyongyang's use of ballistic missile technology in violation of UN Security Council resolutions on Friday, calling for restraint from all relevant parties
China also does not hold the key to the Korean Peninsula issue
She noted that the essence of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is a security issue, and the core is conflict between Pyongyang and Washington
According to Hua, China has strictly and comprehensively implemented UN Security Council resolutions, and has made "enormous sacrifices at a great price"
The ROK's military said it conducted a live-fire drill by mobilizing Hyunmoo-2A ballistic missiles about six minutes after the DPRK's missile launch
Hua also said it is "irresponsible" to blame Beijing for regional tensions after US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called on China to use the "powerful tool" of oil to persuade Pyongyang to reconsider its "current path"

"I think that serious consultations will be held at the international level, and the international community will in fact come up with options that will seriously impact the DPRK," he said
MOSCOW -- Russia strongly condemned the latest missile launch by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), as such provocation will further worsen the situation around the Korean Peninsula, the Kremlin said Friday

To Hyra, it has caused not just residential displacement for African Americans but also political and cultural displacement
He saw major issues of gentrification and segregation in Washington beneath the surface of rapid urban renewal
These changes may look pleasant, but not quite so to Derek Hyra, an associate professor at the American University School of Public Affairs and an expert on neighborhood change
